# Unsupervised Skin Tone Estimation/Segmentation

### General

Estimates skin tone based on an image of a person and at the same time it does a very rough segmentation of skin based on a pixel-wise classifier. If your primary goal is a nice clean segmentation, I would recommend other methods, but for the purpose of estimating skin tone it works okay.

The algorithm is based on [this paper here] and consists of two main steps

  - Foreground and background separation using Otsu's Binarization
  - Pixel-wise skin classifier based on HSV and YCrCb colorspaces

Implemented in MATLAB and OpenCV (Python)
